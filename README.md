## Introduction üöÄ
Welcome to Vali-Flow.Core, the foundational library for the Vali-Flow ecosystem, providing a fluent API to build logical expressions for validation in .NET applications. Designed for seamless integration with LINQ and Entity Framework (EF), Vali-Flow.Core allows developers to construct complex validation conditions in a readable and type-safe manner. It supports a variety of data types and provides methods to build expressions for filtering entities, making it ideal for use in domain logic, repositories, or query pipelines.

## Installation üì¶
To add Vali-Flow.Core to your .NET project, install it via NuGet with the following command:

```sh
dotnet add package Vali-Flow.Core
```
Ensure your project targets a compatible .NET version (e.g., .NET 6.0 or later) for optimal performance. Vali-Flow.Core is lightweight and dependency-free, making it easy to integrate into any .NET application.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Vali-Flow.Core focuses on building expressions that can be used for validation or filtering. The library provides a fluent API through the **ValiFlow<T>** builder, which implements the **IExpression<TBuilder, T>** interface. You can construct conditions, combine them with logical operators (**And**, **Or**), and finalize the builder by generating an expression using **Build()** or **BuildNegated()**.

### Basic Example

Here‚Äôs how you can build a simple expression to filter Product entities:

```csharp
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using Vali_Flow.Core.Builder;

var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .Add(p => p.Name != null)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = validator.Build();
```
This expression can be used in a LINQ query or with Entity Framework to filter products where the name is not null and the price is greater than 0.

## Key Methods üìù

Vali-Flow.Core provides methods to construct and finalize logical expressions. Below are the key methods for terminating the builder and generating expressions:

### Build üèóÔ∏è

Generates a boolean expression (**Expression<Func<T, bool>>**) from the conditions defined in the builder. This expression can be used in LINQ queries or Entity Framework to filter entities.

```csharp
var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .Add(p => p.Name != null)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = validator.Build();

// Use the expression in a query
var validProducts = dbContext.Products.Where(filter).ToList();
```

### BuildNegated üîÑ

Generates a negated version of the expression produced by **Build()**. This is useful when you need to find entities that do not satisfy the defined conditions.

```csharp
var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .Add(p => p.Name != null)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> negatedFilter = validator.BuildNegated();

// Use the negated expression in a query
var invalidProducts = dbContext.Products.Where(negatedFilter).ToList();
```

## Building Complex Conditions üß©

Vali-Flow.Core allows you to create complex expressions using logical operators (**And**, **Or**) and sub-groups (**AddSubGroup**). Here are some examples:

### Using **And** and **Or**

Combine conditions with logical operators to create sophisticated filters:

```csharp
var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.Name, name => name.StartsWith("A"))
    .Or()
    .Add(p => p.CreatedAt, date => date.Year == 2023);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = validator.Build();
```
This expression filters products where the price is greater than 0 AND the name starts with "A", OR the creation year is 2023.

### Using **AddSubGroup**

Group conditions to create nested expressions:

```csharp
var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .AddSubGroup(group => group
        .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0)
        .And()
        .Add(p => p.Name, name => name.Length > 3))
    .Or()
    .Add(p => p.IsActive, isActive => isActive == true);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = validator.Build();
```

This expression filters products where (price > 0 AND name length > 3) OR the product is active.

## Comparison: Without vs. With Vali-Flow.Core ‚öñÔ∏è

### Without Vali-Flow.Core (Manual Expression Building)

Manually building expressions can be cumbersome and error-prone:

```csharp
Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = p =>
    p.Name != null &&
    p.Price > 0 &&
    p.CreatedAt.Date == DateTime.Today;
```

### With Vali-Flow.Core (Fluent Expression Building)

Vali-Flow.Core simplifies the process with a fluent and readable API:

```csharp
var validator = new ValiFlow<Product>()
    .Add(p => p.Name != null)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.Price, price => price > 0)
    .And()
    .Add(p => p.CreatedAt, date => date.Date == DateTime.Today);

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> filter = validator.Build();
```
## Features and Enhancements üåü

### Recent Updates

- Fixed operator precedence for **And/Or** operations in BaseExpression. Now correctly groups conditions combined with OR, ensuring expressions like **`x => x.Deleted == null &amp;&amp; (string.IsNullOrEmpty(request.Search) || x.Nombre.Contains(request.Search))`** are generated as expected.
- Replaced  **`^1`** operator with  **`_conditions.Count - 1`** in **And/Or** methods to ensure compatibility with C# versions prior to 8.0, resolving compilation errors.
- Added  **`Contains`** method with support for **`StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`** , allowing case-insensitive string comparisons without using **`ToLower()`** or **`ToUpper()`**. Improves readability and performance.
- Improved consistency between **`Add().Or().Add()`** and **`AddSubGroup`**, ensuring both approaches produce the same correct results.
- Enhanced code readability and maintainability by encapsulating case-insensitive comparison logic in the `Contains` method.


### Planned Features

- Support for more complex expression transformations.
- Integration with advanced LINQ query optimization techniques.
